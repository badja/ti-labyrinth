How to Run
==========
Labyrinth requires ION to run.

To run Labyrinth, send the LABYRNTH.83P or LABYRNTH.8XP file to your
calculator. Start ION. Now you can run Labyrinth.


About
=====
Labyrinth is a game in which you must find your way through 16 randomly-
generated mazes. Each maze is rendered with a different graphical style, and
there are two modes of play: maze and antimaze.


How to Play
===========
At the title screen, use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to select the game mode
(maze or antimaze), then press 2nd. Select "Maze" mode to start with.

You will then be presented with a maze (or at least part of one) in which you
are represented by a small black square. Use the arrow keys to move around.
The maze is larger than the screen, so the display will scroll as you move
towards the edge. The exit is always on the bottom edge of the maze, but not
always in the same position. Find the exit and you're on to the next level.
Each level is rendered with a different graphical style, which in later levels
make the mazes more difficult.


Antimaze Mode
=============
The idea of an antimaze is simple in theory, but confusing to play. In
antimaze mode, you can move over maze walls, but you cannot move where there
are no walls. This may seem horribly convoluted at first, but after a while
you will get the hang of it and enjoy the challenge.


Auto Save
=========
Labyrinth keeps track of your progress on each of the two modes (maze and
antimaze). If you end a game (by pressing CLEAR), you will be taken to the
start of the same level when you next play that mode. However, the maze will
be a different randomly-generated one.

On title screen, the current level for the selcted game mode is displayed. To
restart a game, select the mode and press DEL.

About the Mazes
===============
Each level is a 15 x 16 maze with only one solution. There are no "islands",
so you cannot travel in a circuit and there is only one path between any two
points. In maze mode, all the walls are connected to each other. The original
maze-generation code was written in Basic and is copyright 1979 by Creative
Computing, Morristown, NJ.
